title: Add
description: Add dependencies to a manifest file
---

## SYNOPSIS
`cargo buckal add` [*options*] *crate*...


## DESCRIPTION
This command can add or modify dependencies, applying the changes to both `Cargo.toml` and `BUCK` files.

The source for the dependency can be specified with *crate*`@`*version*, which fetches the crate from a registry with the version constraint “version”.

When you add a package that is already present, the existing entry will be updated with the flags specified.


## OPTIONS
- `-W, --workspace` Add dependencies in workspace mode. If the crate is already present in the workspace manifest, buckal uses the version defined there; otherwise, it adds the version specified in the command to the workspace.
- `-F, --features <FEATURES>` Space or comma separated list of features to activate. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.
- `--rename <NAME>` Rename the dependency.
- `--dev` Add as a development dependency.
- `--build` Add as a build dependency.
