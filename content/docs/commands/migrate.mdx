## SYNOPSIS
`cargo buckal migrate` [*options*]

## DESCRIPTION
Seamlessly migrate existing Cargo packages to Buck2.

## OPTIONS
- `--no-cache` Do not use cached data from previous runs.
- `--merge` Merge manual edits with generated content.
- `--init [<PATH>]` Migrate with buck2 initialized in the specified path (defaults to current directory).
- `--fetch` Fetch latest bundles from remote repository.
