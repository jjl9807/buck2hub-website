description: Update dependencies in a manifest file

## SYNOPSIS
`cargo buckal update` [*options*] *spec*


## DESCRIPTION
This command is an alias for `cargo update`, which will update dependencies in the `Cargo.lock` file to the latest version.


## OPTIONS
- `-w, --workspace` Attempt to update only packages defined in the workspace. Other packages are updated only if they don’t already exist in the lockfile. This option is useful for updating `Cargo.lock` after you’ve changed version numbers in `Cargo.toml`.
- `--dry-run` Displays what would be updated, but doesn’t actually write the lockfile.
