title: Init
description: Create a new package in an existing directory
---

## SYNOPSIS
`cargo buckal init` [*options*]


## DESCRIPTION
Create a new package in the current directory and initialize both Cargo and Buck2 configurations.

This command is equivalent to running `cargo init` and creating a empty BUCK file by default. However, when invoked with `--repo` or `--lite`, buckal additionally performs the following steps:

- **Configures the [buckal cell](https://github.com/buck2hub/buckal-bundles)**: Sets up a custom Rust prelude that enhances Cargo compatibility on top of Buck2’s official preludes.
- **Extracts Buck2 assets**: Installs toolchain- and platform-specific definitions to enable cross-platform compatibility and cross-compilation.
- **Initializes cfg modifiers**: Configures conditional compilation modifiers to support switching between different build modes.

See [`cargo buckal new`](new) for a similar command which will create a new package in a new directory.


## OPTIONS
- `--bin` Create a package with a binary target (`src/main.rs`). This is the default behavior.
- `--lib` Create a package with a library target (`src/lib.rs`).
- `--edition <EDITION>` Specify the Rust edition to use. Default is 2024. Possible values: 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024.
- `--name <NAME>` Set the package name. Defaults to the directory name.
- `--repo` Creates only a monorepo (Buck2 project) without performing any Cargo initialization. This option is **mutually exclusive with all others**, as it effectively serves as an enhanced version of `buck2 init`. When using it, you must separately initialize Cargo packages or manually set up a Cargo workspace.
- `--lite` Sets up a monorepo (Buck2 project) and creates a simple package. This option does not create a Cargo workspace and is only recommended for small projects or quick tests.
