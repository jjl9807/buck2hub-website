## Welcome to Buckal!
Buckal (also known as `cargo-buckal`), is a plugin that enables seamless migration from Cargo to Buck2, ensures that changes to `Cargo.toml` are automatically reflected in the generated `BUCK` files. This allows developers to use Buck2 with a familiar, Cargo-like workflow — without manual build file maintenance.

## Install Buckal
You can install Buckal from crates.io with a single command:
```bash
cargo install cargo-buckal
```
<Callout title="NOTE">Buckal requires [Buck2](https://buck2.build/) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/). Please ensure both are installed on your system before proceeding.</Callout>


## Migrate existing Cargo projects
For any Cargo project that builds successfully, you can migrate to Buck2 with zero configuration by running the following command in a valid directory (one containing `Cargo.toml`). Buckal will automatically initialize the Buck2 project configuration and convert the Cargo dependency graph into `BUCK` files.
```bash
cargo buckal migrate --buck2
```


## Create a Project from Scratch
Buck2 organizes projects in a monorepo structure, so you first need to create the repository:
```bash
cargo buckal new <repo_path> --repo
```
After that, you must manually set up a Cargo workspace to align with the monorepo layout. Once the workspace is ready, you can create new crates in appropriate locations within it:
```bash
cargo buckal new <crate_path>
```
Buckal will initialize both Cargo and Buck2 configurations automatically, but don't forget to manually add it to the `workspace.members` array in workspace manifest.

<Callout>If your project consists of only a single crate and does not require a workspace, you can use the `--lite` option instead of `--repo` in the first step. This lets Buckal initialize both the repository and the crate in one go, eliminating the need for any further setup.</Callout>


## Common Operations
The following describes common development tasks with Buckal. For detailed usage, see [Buckal Commands](docs/commands).
### Add a Dependency
Inside your package directory, use the familiar Cargo-like syntax to add a dependency:
```bash
cargo buckal add <DEP>[@<VERSION>] [--features <FEATURES>]
```
### Build the Package
To build your crate with Buck2, run:
```bash
cargo buckal build
```
### Remove generated artifacts
Delete generated files and caches, and kill the buck2 daemon:
```bash
cargo buckal clean
```
### Migrate After Manual Edits
If you edit `Cargo.toml` directly (e.g., adding dependencies or updating package version by hand), synchronize the changes to BUCK files by running:
```bash
cargo buckal migrate
```
